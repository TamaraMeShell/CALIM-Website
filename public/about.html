            <br>
            <p> 
                Words cannot express the gratitude for your labor that went into making the Family and Friends Day at CALIM a Jesus Class success. Our living for God is because we are saved; our giving to God is sharing our resources, tithe, time, talents, and creativity to serve in the Kingdom. This showed on Sunday. What a critical understanding of the importance of being spiritually employed and continuously working, improving, and evolving in Kingdom work. Wow, “And their works do follow them!” 
                Stay miracle-minded and Kingdom-focused as we fight for our families during this season of recovery.

        <h1>Church History</h1>

            <div class="church-history" id="church">

                <p>God honored Pastor Derrick E. Flanagan, Sr. with a vision to birth a ministry of excellence, faith
                    and integrity-Christ Abundant Life Christian Ministries.
                    God’s vision is that of a growing church, crossing the lines of the traditions of men and
                    denominations, teaching the uncompromised word of God with simplicity and understanding.
                    <br><br>
                    God’s vision manifested on October 12, 1998. Pastor Flanagan began a bible study in his home, which
                    was filled to capacity the first night. It continued to increase by word of mouth for two months and
                    Christ Abundant Life came forth.
                    On March 7, 1999, the first service was held with seven charter members at the Ramada Inn on
                    Cherokee Boulevard in Douglasville, Georgia. The service was filled to capacity with over 100 people
                    in attendance.
                    The church was asked not to return to the Ramada Inn because the overwhelming attendance was too
                    loud, which subsequently broke the fire codes.
                    <br><br>
                    On January 28, 2000, the church moved to its present location at 8388 Cherokee Boulevard. Because of
                    the demand for space to serve the community and current ministries throughout the church, it is
                    evident that the present facility is inadequate for present needs and future growth.
